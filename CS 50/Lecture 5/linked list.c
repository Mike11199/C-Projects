//Linked lists are more efficient than arrays as you don't have to copy your original array into a new array each time.  You can grow and shrink the data.
// They are a series of nodes that are connected via pointers.  So don't have to be contiguous as an array in C.  Running time of searching a linked list is O(n).  
//Inserting into a linked list is O(1).

//Running time of inserting into an array is linear time O(n) or omega(1) if already empty as lower.
//Always check if NULL if calling a function that returns to you a pointer!!

//Instead of  (*n).number = 1; can use the -> syntactic sugar.  
//vector is an array that can be resized or shrinked.  This is NOT what arrays are in C.
