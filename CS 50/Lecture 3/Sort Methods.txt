Big O Notation:  	O stands for order; the upper bound of asymptotic complexity.
Ω: 		 	Omega or lower bound.
θ:			Theta.  When upper bound and lower bound are the same.



Linear Search:  

		Upper Bound - O(n) 
		Lower Bound - Ω(1)





Binary Search  (Divides in half):  

		Upper Bound - O(log n)
		Lower Bound - Ω(1)


			Pick up phone book
			Open to middle of phone book
			Look at page
			If person is on page
				Call person
			Else if person is earlier in book
				Open to middle of left half of book
				Go back to line 3
			Else if person is later in book	
				Open to middle of right half of book
				Go back to line 3
			Else
				Quit





Selection Sort: 

		Upper Bound - O(n^2)
		Lower Bound - Ω(n^2)
			or
			    - θ(n^2)
	
	
	
			For i from 0 to n-1
				Find smallest item between i'th item and the last item
				Swap smallest item with the i'th item





Bubble Sort:

		
		Upper Bound -  O(n^2) 
		Lower Bound - Ω(n)
	

			Repeat until sorted
				For i from 0 to n-2
					If i'th and the i+1'th element out of order
					Swap them
				If no swaps
					Quit





Recursion:
	
	-The ability for a function to call itself.  Uses different input each time or else output
	would be exactly the same.  Change input to be smaller each time.  


		Upper Bound - 
		Lower Bound -

Merge Sort:


		Upper Bound - O(n log n)
		Lower Bound - Ω(n log n)
			or
			    - θ(n^2)



			If only one number
